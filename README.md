## About Me
👋 Heyo! I'm Hitarth, a __Computer Science Student @ University of Houston__, with a sweet spot for Quite a lot of Hobbies (Space, Tech, Podcasts, and Reading)

## What I do
- 🌱 Working on building my Startup, BestFit.
- 🛠️ I love to hack on stuff, especially at Hackathons! I have been to 10 hackathons and counting in the past 2 years.
- 🪛 In my (sparse) free time I love to tinker with my Home Lab, and I am working on a project to simulate a bunch of satellites on it using Rust. (Please reach out with cool ideas!)
